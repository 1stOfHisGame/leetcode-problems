# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
[Solve it on leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.<br>
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).<br>
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.<br>

### Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]<br>
nums2 = [2]<br>
The median is 2.0<br>

### Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]<br>
nums2 = [3, 4]<br>
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5<br>
