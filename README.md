### Disclaimer:
- In spite of most leetcode problems not asking for a main method, you might still see one in solutions here. I added it to test initial cases, while solving it locally.
- All the solutions uploaded here have passed every test case and has been accepted at the time of my submission.
- You can also check out the problems listed here on leetcode site, I've hyperlinked the problem numbers. 
- I do not own, nor did I design any of the problems listed here. But the solutions are all my doing.
